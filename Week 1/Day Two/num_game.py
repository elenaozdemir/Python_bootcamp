# HOT & COLD GAME
# Create a game where the range of numbers will be between 0-100
# Number of guesses = 10
# If user is within 5 of the winning number, print hot ( 5 & -5)
# If within 10, print warm (-10, 10)
# For everything else it will be cold
# Keep track of all the user guesses in a list

# When the game is over, print out the 
# 1 - number of tries the user took
# 2 - their guesses
